Overview

This lab explores basic digital input and output functionality using the AVR128DB48 microcontroller. The tasks focus on using switches as inputs and LEDs as outputs while utilizing internal pull-up resistors.

Tasks

1. SW0_controls_LED0_mod.asm

Description: This program configures a switch as an input with an internal pull-up resistor. When the switch is pressed, it completes the circuit and turns on an LED connected to an output pin.

Key Features:

Uses an internal pull-up resistor to ensure a defined logic level when the switch is not pressed.

Configures the LED output to be controlled by the switch state.

2. ex_PB_controls_ex_LED

Description: Similar to the first task, this program implements a pushbutton switch with an internal pull-up resistor to control an LED.

Key Features:

Pushbutton input is configured using an internal pull-up resistor.

Pressing the pushbutton turns on an external LED.

Learning Outcomes

Understanding how to use internal pull-up resistors in microcontrollers.

Configuring GPIO pins for digital input and output operations.

Implementing basic switch debouncing concepts in embedded systems.

Usage Instructions

Assemble and upload the provided .asm files to the AVR128DB48 microcontroller.

Connect the circuit:

Ensure the switch/pushbutton is properly wired with the designated input pin.

Connect the LED to the assigned output pin with an appropriate current-limiting resistor.

Observe the LED turning on when the switch/pushbutton is pressed.

Notes

If the LED does not turn on as expected, verify that the pull-up resistor is correctly configured.

Check wiring and ensure the microcontroller is correctly powered.

This lab provides fundamental knowledge for working with digital I/O, forming the basis for more complex embedded system applications.
